    <string name="bubbleDefination">Defination : Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.</string>

    <string name="defination_warshall">Defination : The Floyd-Warshall algorithm, named after its creators Robert Floyd and Stephen Warshall, is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and graph theory. It is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. This algorithm is highly efficient and can handle graphs with both positive and negative edge weights, making it a versatile tool for solving a wide range of network and connectivity problems.</string>
    <string name="complexity_floyd">Time Complexity: \tO(V3), where V is the number of vertices in the graph and we run three nested loops each of size V\n\n Auxiliary Space: \tO(V2), to create a 2-D matrix in order to store the shortest distance for each pair of nodes.</string>
    <string name="Inserion_Defination">Defination : Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It is considered an “in-place” sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn’t require any additional memory space beyond the original array.</string>
    <string name="insertion_sort_complexity">Time Complexity: \nBest case: O(n), If the list is already sorted, where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\n Average case: O(n^2), If the list is randomly ordered\n\n Worst case: O(n^2), If the list is in reverse order\n\n Auxiliary Space: O(1)</string>
    <string name="selection_defination">Defination: Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.</string>
