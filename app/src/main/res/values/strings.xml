    <string name="bubbleDefination">Defination : Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.</string>

    <string name="defination_warshall">Defination : The Floyd-Warshall algorithm, named after its creators Robert Floyd and Stephen Warshall, is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and graph theory. It is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. This algorithm is highly efficient and can handle graphs with both positive and negative edge weights, making it a versatile tool for solving a wide range of network and connectivity problems.</string>
